 the output of multiple linear regression using the lm() function produces the coefficients for each variable in the linear equation.above image shows the coefficient for vehicle_weight,spoiler_angle,ground_clearence,AWD and MPG. 
 
## Results



Using differnt parameters(field) in NYC city bike sharing data like starttime,endtime,gender etc. find out following results:-

### 1. checkout times for users:-

   Following image shows Checkout times for users for every hours in day means it shows tripduration for particular minute and  particular hour. For example 104824 rides checkout by Male 34151 rides checkout by Female and 6172 rides checkout by Unknown for Hour of tripduration: 0 and Minute of tripduration:6 .



### 2. checkout times by gender :-

   Following image shows Checkout times for users by gender for every hours in day means it shows tripduration for particular minute and  particular hour gender wise. For example 375 rides for Hour of tripduration: 1 and Minute of tripduration:19 .

### 3. Trips by weekday for each hour :-

   Following image shows Number of bike trips by weekday for each hour of the day means it shows tripduration for particular hour and  particular weeday. For example 43982 rides for Hour of staettime: 5 PM and Weekday of stoptime is Thursday.
